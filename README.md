# EECE4263 Final Project:

For your final project youâ€™ll create a wireless IoT device capable of exchanging Ring-Ring messages with other Ring-Ring devices. All messages will be transmitted wirelessly via MQTT using the ECE MQTT broker. This project requires an understanding of embedded systems design, hardware interfacing, the MQTT messaging protocol, MQTT brokers, JSON payloads, and MQTT-Spy. Turn-ins include a demonstration of your working project, your project code, and a final report.

Enjoy!
